# utmthesis
The LaTeX class for Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) thesis.  

## Description

The utmthesis project provides and maintains a LaTeX class, BibTeX styles (for both authordate and number citation styles) as well as a LyX layout to typeset your thesis according to the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) thesis formatting rules. It is currently the most time saving and efficient way to write a UTM compliant thesis.  

This is an ongoing project and it a free software project licensed under the New BSD License.

Even though you just spent 1-2 days writing the content of your thesis (because you are lazy), you can instantly generate the entire thesis in PDF with fully formatted table of contents, references, appendix, front cover, etc. This results in a beautifully written shiny magical thesis that will bedazzle your supervisors and examiners, guaranteeing you an A+.. or not.

There are tutorials, tips & examples on how to use LaTeX provided in the downloads and wiki section.

Download the latest version of utmthesis (both in LaTeX and LyX) here! Due to upload limitation imposed by Google, we could not upload new updates here. Temporarily, we provide download links from FKE Postgraduate Website while we are trying to resolve the upload restriction here.

## Versions
Current stable release: version 6.1

## Required Software
1.  A good LaTeX compiler.  For Windows users, you may try MikTeX or ProTeXt. For Linux users, install TeX Live. Note: If you install a minimal/basic version of a Latex compiler, you will face problems. Go for the full download.  For Ubuntu (or Debian based distros) type the following command in your shell to auto-magically install all the above software like a boss:

    sudo apt-get install texlive-full texmaker jabref
