abstract = {Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition (TSDR) plays a crucial role in driver assistance systems, and provides drivers with safety and precaution information. It is part of the computer vision which requires a dataset for training and testing the detection and recognition techniques. In this paper, a dataset for Malaysian TS (MTSD) is proposed in order to eliminate the gap in the previously created datasets. The MTSD includes a variety of TS scenes to be used in TS detection and images contain only TS to assist in the recognition of TS.},

abstract = {Developing a safe and efficient collision avoidance policy for multiple robots is challenging in the decentralized scenarios where each robot generates its paths without observing other robots' states and intents. While other distributed multi-robot collision avoidance systems exist, they often require extracting agent-level features to plan a local collision-free action, which can be computationally prohibitive and not robust. More importantly, in practice the performance of these methods are much lower than their centralized counterparts. We present a decentralized sensor-level collision avoidance policy for multi-robot systems, which directly maps raw sensor measurements to an agent's steering commands in terms of movement velocity. As a first step toward reducing the performance gap between decentralized and centralized methods, we present a multi-scenario multi-stage training framework to learn an optimal policy. The policy is trained over a large number of robots on rich, complex environments simultaneously using a policy gradient based reinforcement learning algorithm. We validate the learned sensor-level collision avoidance policy in a variety of simulated scenarios with thorough performance evaluations and show that the final learned policy is able to find time efficient, collision-free paths for a large-scale robot system. We also demonstrate that the learned policy can be well generalized to new scenarios that do not appear in the entire training period, including navigating a heterogeneous group of robots and a large-scale scenario with 100 robots.

abstract = {Learning visual models of object categories notoriously requires hundreds or thousands of training examples. We show that it is possible to learn much information about a category from just one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming from previously learned categories, no matter how different these categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We compare category models learned by an implementation of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces informative models when the number of training examples is too small for other methods to operate successfully.},

abstract = {Why are probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planners "probabilistic"? This paper tries to establish the probabilistic foundations of PRM planning and reexamines previous work in this context. It shows that the success of PRM planning depends mainly and critically on the assumption that the configuration space C of a robot often verifies favorable "visibility" properties that are not directly dependent on the dimensionality of C. A promising way of speeding up PRM planners is to extract partial knowledge on such properties during roadmap construction and use this knowledge to adjust the sampling measure continuously. This paper also shows that the choice of the sampling source-pseudo-random or deterministic-has small impact on a PRM planner's performance, compared to that of the sampling measure. These conclusions are supported by both theoretical arguments and empirical results.},

abstract = {There are many slaughter procedures that religions and cultures use around the world. The two that are commercially relevant are the halal and kosher methods practiced by Muslims and Jews respectively. The global trade in red meat and poultry produced using these two methods is substantial, thus the importance of the quality of the meat produced using the methods. Halal and kosher slaughter per se should not affect meat quality more than their industrial equivalents, however, some of their associated pre- and post-slaughter processes do. For instance, the slow decline in blood pressure following a halal pre-slaughter head-only stun and neck cut causes blood splash (ecchymosis) in a range of muscles and organs of slaughtered livestock. Other quality concerns include bruising, hemorrhages, skin discoloration and broken bones particularly in poultry. In addition to these conventional quality issues, the "spiritual quality" of the meat can also be affected when the halal and kosher religious requirements are not fully met during the slaughter process. The nature, causes, importance and mitigations of these and other quality issues related to halal and kosher slaughtering and meat production using these methods are the subjects of this review. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Participating observations on slaughterhouses was performed with cooperation of MGI Committee Staff under the Halal Monitoring Schedules, meanwhile individual observations was done personally after obtaining permission from slaughterhouses personnel. The result showed that there were weaknesses in filing record system and halal monitoring by JHEAINS, including differentiation of guidelines and terms of Islamic Animal Slaughter and slaughterhouse scales compared to JAKIM. All slaughterhouses in study were found to comply with halal certification documentation system and halal chicken processing. Meanwhile, Halal inspectors from RSA, RSB, and RSC leave their location without replacement and did not perform detail observation on post slaughtered chicken. Keywo},

To address this issue, we focus on the problem of multi-robot task allocation (MRTA). Most work on MRTA has been ad hoc and empirical, with many coordination architectures having been proposed and validated in a proof-of-concept fashion, but infrequently analyzed. With the goal of bringing objective grounding to this important area of research, we present a formal study of MRTA problems. A domain-independent taxonomy of MRTA problems is given, and it is shown how many such problems can be viewed as instances of other, well-studied, optimization problems. We demonstrate how relevant theory from operations research and combinatorial optimization can be used for analysis and greater understanding of existing approaches to task allocation, and to show how the same theory can be used in the synthesis of new approaches.},

Complete information about a freespace and goal is encoded in the form of a special artificial potential function, called a navigation function, that connects the kinematic planning problem with the dynamic execution problem in a provably correct fashion. The navigation function automatically gives rise to a bounded-torque feedback controller for the robot's actuators that guarantees collision-free motion and convergence to the destination from almost all initial free configurations. A formula for navigation functions that guide a point-mass robot in a generalized sphere world is developed. The simplest member of this family is a space obtained by puncturing a disk by an arbitrary number of smaller disjoint disks representing obstacles. The other spaces are obtained from this model by a suitable coordinate transformation. Simulation results for planar scenarios are provided},

After reviewing important advances in this field, some challenging problems and promising research directions are analyzed. A concluding remark is made from the perspectives of the authors. I.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account 1 , deeply rooted in psychological 2 and neuroscientific 3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6-8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9-11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games 12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks. We set out to create a single algorithm that would be able to develop a wide range of competencies on a varied range of challenging tasks-a central goal of general artificial intelligence 13 that has eluded previous efforts 8,14,15. To achieve this, we developed a novel agent, a deep Q-network (DQN), which is able to combine reinforcement learning with a class of artificial neural network 16 known as deep neural networks. Notably, recent advances in deep neural networks 9-11 , in which several layers of nodes are used to build up progressively more abstract representations of the data, have made it possible for artificial neural networks to learn concepts such as object categories directly from raw sensory data. We use one particularly successful architecture, the deep convolutional network 17 , which uses hierarchical layers of tiled convolutional filters to mimic the effects of receptive fields-inspired by Hubel and Wiesel's seminal work on feedforward processing in early visual cortex 18-thereby exploiting the local spatial correlations present in images, and building in robustness to natural transformations such as changes of viewpoint or scale. We consider tasks in which the agent interacts with an environment through a sequence of observations, actions and rewards. The goal of the agent is to select actions in a fashion that maximizes cumulative future reward. More formally, we use a deep convolutional neural network to approximate the optimal action-value function Q {\~{A}} s,a ð Þ{\~{}} max p r t zcr tz1 zc 2 r tz2 z. .. js t {\~{}}s, a t {\~{}}a, p {\^{A}} {\~{A}} , which is the maximum sum of rewards r t discounted by c at each time-step t, achievable by a behaviour policy p 5 P(ajs), after making an observation (s) and taking an action (a) (see Methods) 19. Reinforcement learning is known to be unstable or even to diverge when a nonlinear function approximator such as a neural network is used to represent the action-value (also known as Q) function 20. This instability has several causes: the correlations present in the sequence of observations, the fact that small updates to Q may significantly change the policy and therefore change the data distribution, and the correlations between the action-values (Q) and the target values rzc max a 0 Q s 0 , a 0 ð Þ. We address these instabilities with a novel variant of Q-learning, which uses two key ideas. First, we used a biologically inspired mechanism termed experience replay 21-23 that randomizes over the data, thereby removing correlations in the observation sequence and smoothing over changes in the data distribution (see below for details). Second, we used an iterative update that adjusts the action-values (Q) towards target values that are only periodically updated, thereby reducing correlations with the target. While other stable methods exist for training neural networks in the reinforcement learning setting, such as neural fitted Q-iteration 24 , these methods involve the repeated training of networks de novo on hundreds of iterations. Consequently, these methods, unlike our algorithm, are too inefficient to be used successfully with large neural networks. We parameterize an approximate value function Q(s,a;h i) using the deep convolutional neural network shown in Fig. 1, in which h i are the parameters (that is, weights) of the Q-network at iteration i. To perform experience replay we store the agent's experiences e t 5 (s t ,a t ,r t ,s t 1 1) at each time-step t in a data set D t 5 {\{}e 1 ,{\ldots},e t {\}}. During learning, we apply Q-learning updates, on samples (or minibatches) of experience (s,a,r,s9) , U(D), drawn uniformly at random from the pool of stored samples. The Q-learning update at iteration i uses the following loss function:},

abstract = {Multi-robot systems (MRS) are a group of robots that are designed aiming to perform some collective behavior. By this collective behavior, some goals that are impossible for a single robot to achieve become feasible and attainable. There are several foreseen benefits of MRS compared to single robot systems such as the increased ability to resolve task complexity, increasing performance, reliability and simplicity in design. These benefits have attracted many researchers from academia and industry to investigate how to design and develop robust versatile MRS by solving a number of challenging problems such as complex task allocation, group formation, cooperative object detection and tracking, communication relaying and self-organization to name just a few. One of the most challenging problems of MRS is how to optimally assign a set of robots to a set of tasks in such a way that optimizes the overall system performance subject to a set of constraints. This problem is known as Multi-robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem. MRTA is a complex problem especially when it comes to heterogeneous unreliable robots equipped with different capabilities that are required to perform various tasks with different requirements and constraints in an optimal way. This chapter provides a comprehensive review on challenging aspects of MRTA problem, recent approaches to tackle this problem and the future directions.},

abstract = {We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs MPP over four distinct minimization objectives: the makespan (last arrival time), the maximum (single-robot traveled) distance, the total arrival time, and the total distance. In a related paper, we show that these objectives are distinct and NP-hard to optimize. In this work, we focus on efficiently algorithmic solutions for solving these optimal MPP problems. Toward this goal, we first establish a one-to-one solution mapping between MPP and network-flow. Based on this equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel and complete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. In particular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is a first such that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems with robot-vertex ratio as high as 100{\%}. Then, we further improve the computational performance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principled heuristics, at the expense of some optimality loss. The combination of ILP model based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective, allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containing hundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in just seconds.},

The modern technology has emphasized on the need to move a robot in an environment which is dynamically changing. An example of such an application may be the use of robots in industry to carry tools and other materials from one place to other. Since many robots would be working together, we need to ensure a collision free navigation plan for each of the robots. In this paper we find out the nearly most optimal path of the robot using Genetic, ANN and A* algorithms at each instant of time of robot travel. It may be used by the industry to send robots for surveys, data acquisition, doing specific work etc. The collision free movement of robot in a moving obstacle environment can be used to move robot in a world of robots. Results show that all 3 algorithms are able to move the robot without any collisions.},

The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective.

In this paper we study the problem of generating smooth paths and concentrate on angle constrained path planning. We put angle-constrained path planning problem formally and present a new algorithm tailored to solve it - LIAN. We examine LIAN both theoretically and empirically. We show that it is sound and complete (under some restrictions). We also show that LIAN outperforms the analogues when solving numerous path planning tasks within urban outdoor navigation scenarios.},

abstract = {We introduce AutoMoDe: a novel approach to the automatic design of control software for robot swarms. The core idea in AutoMoDe recalls the approach commonly adopted in machine learning for dealing with the bias--variance tradedoff: to obtain suitably general solutions with low variance, an appropriate design bias is injected. AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules---the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable.},

Consistently with the swarm intelligence paradigm, the main focus is on studies characterized by distributed control, simplicity of individual robots and locality of sensing and communication. Distributed algorithms are shown to bring cooperation between agents, obtained in various forms and often without explicitly programming a cooperative behavior in the single robot controllers.

abstract = {Reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling autonomous robots to learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention. However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on offpolicy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efﬁciently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in designing multi-robot systems (hereafter MRSs) to provide cost effective, fault-tolerant and reliable solutions to a variety of automated applications. Here, we review recent advancements in MRSs specifically designed for cooperative object transport, which requires the members of MRSs to coordinate their actions to transport objects from a starting position to a final destination. To achieve cooperative object transport, a wide range of transport, coordination and control strategies have been proposed. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive summary for this relatively heterogeneous and fast-growing body of scientific literature. While distilling the information, we purposefully avoid using hierarchical dichotomies, which have been traditionally used in the field of MRSs. Instead, we employ a coarse-grain approach by classifying each study based on the transport strategy used; pushing-only, grasping and caging. We identify key design constraints that may be shared among these studies despite considerable differences in their design methods. In the end, we discuss several open challenges and possible directions for future work to improve the performance of the current MRSs. Overall, we hope to increase the visibility and accessibility of the excellent studies in the field and provide a framework that helps the reader to navigate through them more effectively.},

abstract = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

abstract = {A multi-robot tractor system for conducting agriculture field work was developed in order to reduce total work time and to improve work efficiency. The robot tractors can form a spatial pattern, I-pattern, V-pattern or W-pattern, during the work process. The safety zones of each robot were defined as a circle and a rectangle. The robots can coordinate to turn to the next lands without collision or deadlock. The efficiency of the system depends on the number of robots, the spatial pattern, the setting distance between each robot, and the field length. Three simulations were carried out to determine the usefulness of the system. The simulation results showed that the efficiency range of three robots using the I-pattern is from 83.2{\%} to 89.8{\%} at a field length of 100 m. The efficiency range of seven robots using the W-pattern is from 59.4{\%} to 65.8{\%} at a field length of 100 m. However, the minimum efficiency of seven robots using the W-pattern is 84.9{\%} at a field length of 500 m. The efficiency would be higher than 85{\%} if the field length was larger than 500 m. Thus, the newly developed multi-robot tractor system is more effective in a large field.},

Despite recent advances in important domains such as vision and language, the standard supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer a satisfactory solution for learning new concepts rapidly from little data. In this work, we employ ideas from metric learning based on deep neural features and from recent advances that augment neural networks with external memories. Our framework learns a network that maps a small labelled support set and an unlabelled example to its label, obviating the need for fine-tuning to adapt to new class types. We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot, ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on ImageNet from 87.6{\%} to 93.2{\%} and from 88.0{\%} to 93.8{\%} on Omniglot compared to competing approaches. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the same model on language modeling by introducing a one-shot task on the Penn Treebank.},
